## Update 08/20/2009

I have had a lot of people emailing me for support for various modules and integration specific questions. Because of this, I have made a commercial product called, [RocketShipIt](https://www.rocketship.it). It supports all the UPS Online Tools APIs as well as generates the 40+ required files you need to get certified with UPS. With the purchase of the product you also get support and help with any integration questions you might have.

## About

This project was started due to an obvious lack of PHP tools to communicate 
with the UPS Shipping API.  The plan for this project is to create reusable 
code for use with all of the UPS shipping tools through thier XML API.

This project will eventually cover all of these UPS API tools.
